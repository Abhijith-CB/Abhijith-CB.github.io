title: My experience with amFOSS tasks 
---
**Hello world** this is my very first blog and this is about how was amfoss asks for me.
First of all a brief introdution about myself Im Abhijith CB from Munnar(UDM) Kerala.
I dont have any prior experience with coding as i was a PCMB student in my intermediates.
Even though i was a bio student I always had passion for electronics.Thats why i would like to join amFOSS Team 
to continue my passion for more intesting projects and contribuitions.

About the tasks that were given to me. When i read the task page i could'nt uderstand most of the task as i was noob.
I almost learned the basics of java script and c programming along with linux commands. I learned a lot during the process.
